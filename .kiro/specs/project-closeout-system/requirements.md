# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will digitize the Project Close-Out Report Form currently used by Woodnork Green. The system will replace the paper-based form with a digital solution that captures all project completion details, enables proper file storage, automates submission workflows, and ensures compliance with data storage policies. The system will streamline the project close-out process while maintaining all required documentation and approval workflows.
